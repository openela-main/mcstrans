Subject: [PATCH] Fix mcstrans secolor examples

According to "check_dominance" function:
Range defined as "s15:c0.c1023" does not dominate any other range than
 "s15:c0.c1023" (does not dominate "s15", "s15:c0.c200", etc.).
While range defined as "s15-s15:c0.c1023" dominates all of the above.

This is either a bug, or "s15:c0.c1023" should not be used in the
examples.
